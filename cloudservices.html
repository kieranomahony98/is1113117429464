	Netflix has pulled back the curtains to provide a behind-the-scenes glimpse into how it runs one of the most popular video<br/> 
	streaming websites on the Internet, almost entirely in the public cloud. The company has open sourced dozens of tools it’s<br/> 
	developed internally. In doing so, some argue that Netflix is turning into one of the most important cloud computing companies<br/>
	in the industry, by sharing with developers how it’s being done and providing others with a path to follow.
